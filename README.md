# Face Blur

## Overview

This is a small project using a neural network to locate and then blur your face.

## Requirements



### Dependencies

To get started, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Reccomened
Any NVIDIA GPU will do better than most AMD or Intel GPU. NVIDIA has Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA which allows it to have better performance with neural networks. This will increase the speed of which your neural network will run and the better it will blur your face.
